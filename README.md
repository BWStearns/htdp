Going through How to Design Computer Programs in Clojure. Pretty much all of the exercises will be done other than those that ask for just scalar answers.

## Maybe?

I grabbed the book because I saw it referenced in a strangeloop talk but it's been fun to go through so far. Maybe I'll write tests for all the questions and clojure-ize the curriculum as a way to make getting into clojure easier.

It'd also be kind of fun to build the "teachpacks" out so that you could do things like the GUI programming in Ch1/Section6. I haven't done Java GUI programming before so that could be kind of fun.
